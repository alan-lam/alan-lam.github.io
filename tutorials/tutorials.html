          <p>Welcome to my modest page of tutorials!</p>
          <p>With the exception of HTML/CSS, my goal with the coding tutorials is to introduce basic concepts of programming. Not the language! That's why they're titled "Intro to CS" and not "Intro to Java".</p>
          <p>They're designed to be short and straight to the point. I focus only on <b>some</b> of the important concepts that are commonly used in currently popular programming languages and skip over other basic concepts that I think are irrelevant in the early stages of learning or are easy to pick up later (e.g. input, other variable types, casting, switch). I also remove the overhead of setting up the tools and environment. </p>
          <p>They're designed to be interactive. Instead of going "Here's how to do this, here's how to do this, ...", I let the user do all the typing.</p>
          <p>They're designed to be representative. I introduce a problem to solve and provide resources for figuring out how to solve them. This simluates an actual programming experience in which you learn about your problem and apply/modify it to your current problem. (Except I did the Googling part already).</p>
          <p>That being said, these are not complete tutorials and should not be treated as such. The hardest part about learning is the beginning and I hope to overcome that difficulty with these tutorials.</p>
          <p>P.S. With the exception of HTML/CSS, the exercises are pretty much all the same.</p>
