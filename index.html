            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi. I'm Alan. I am a 3rd year Math-Computer Science major at UCSD.</p>
            <p>My "attachment" to the natural logarithm has nothing to do with it's mathematical properties. It's more of an English thing (think special fx).</p>
            <p>The best "<a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-largest-number-2" target="_blank">anti-proof</a>".</p>
            <p>Speaking of comics, I've come to like Munroe's title-text style.</p>
            <p>The beauty/complicated-ness of English:</p>
            <p id="tab">Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose</p>
            <p id="tab">"The great big old red Chinese wooden cooking tool"</p>
            <p id="tab">I've tried selling a "gray old big backpack" on a few online marketplaces, but no one was able to identify the language I was using to describe it.</p>
            <p>A great Jeopardy clue:</p>
            <p id="tab">"Of the words in the acronym GOAT, the one in the superlative degree."</p>
            <p id="tab">I am occasionally ribbed by some friends who call me goat because of my last name, but I prefer to interpret it, as the clue suggests, as a compliment.</p>
            <p>57*, 72, and 73 are funny, and 62, 63, and 64 smell good.</p>
            <p id="tab">It would've been nice to have one set of numbers that are funny and smell good, but I doubt Mendeleev would've approved.</p>
            <p id="tab">*some images are better than others</p>
            <p>Eternal return is pretty intriguing. Wait, have I said that already?</p>
            <p id="tab">To avoid thinking about this in the future, I'll stop thinking about it now. Unless past me has already thought about it. Has he?</p>
