      <h4 class="title">The Beginning</h4>
      <h6 class="date">April 28, 2018</h6>
      <p>I've never fancied myself a great writer. Or even a writer, for that matter. In fact, I don't even know why I'm writing this. Not just this post, but this sentence.</p>
      <p>This word.</p>
      <p>This letter.</p>
      <p>Letter. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm just writing a letter and mailing it to no one in particular. Maybe someone will open their mailbox and find this letter waiting to be opened and read. Or maybe it will get lost in the mail and never be read.</p>
      <p>I suppose this would be the beginning of this "blog". The problem with the beginning is you never know what's at the end or what you might find along the way. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing. But does the road through the beginning always have to be such a long and difficult one? There are no other roads and I've already come this far. So I might as well just keep going. Who knows? This might turn out to be a fun adventure.</p>

      <h6 class="date">April 29, 2018</h6>
      <p>What is a function? Those of you familiar with programming might say that a function is a piece of code that is reused throughout your code to perform a task. Those of you thinking in terms of higher-level math might define it as a mapping from a set to another set. Those of you more comfortable with lower-level math might describe it as ... well, I'm not sure actually.</p>
      <button id="more_function_button" onclick="functions()">Read more</button>
      <div id="more_function">
        <p>I remember being asked this question at an interview. It was for a tutoring position where I would have to help children with programming. So I had to explain what a function was so that a child could understand.</p>
        <p>This question was thrown at me like a spear and it grazed my brain. It stopped for a few seconds in shock, realizing what could've happened if the spear had been thrown a few more millimeters to the side. I had been programming with functions for 2 years and I still didn't know what they were!? My brain started running around in circles. It fell, got back up, started running, fell again, got back up again, started running again... When it finally stopped to rest, it came up with "a function is something that takes in an input, does something with it, and returns an output".</p>
        <p>Not the best answer, but the best I could come up with in such a short amount of time. After saying it, I immediately thought of functions with no parameters and void signatures (functions with no input and no output). But that wasn't the main issue with my answer. My answer was no better than telling you that a function is something that does something.</p>
        <p>I didn't get the position, which was no surprise to me. It wasn't just that question that killed my chances, but that's a different story. That spear left a lasting impression on me that still hurts to this day. How many concepts have I been using for a long time without thinking about what they were?</p>
        <p>How many of those do I actually know how to explain?</p>

      <h4 class="title">High School Culturalism</h4>
      <h6 class="date">April 30, 2018</h6>
      <p>I'm sitting in a chair, but I don't fit in it. It's a normal, plastic chair that an average-sized adult could sit on. It's a normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. It's a normal, plastic chair.</p>
      <button id="more_hs_culture_button" onclick="hsCulture()">Read more</button>
      <div id="more_hs_culture">
        <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm in a high school classroom. If you walk into the room and look around, you would see a bunch of students. If you happened to look at me, you would think I was just another student. There was nothing about my faded blue sweater, light gray t-shirt, and coal black jeans that made me look different from everyone else. Just another student. Yet I didn't feel like I was one of them. Yeah, I was a college student tutoring at a high school. But that wasn't it. After all, I was still a student, and I had been in their shoes only 4 years ago. I was sitting in a normal, plastic chair just like they all were. The problem was, I wasn't part of their "student culture" anymore.</p>
        <p>I wasn't actually "part" of it, just around people who were. It was normal to hate school and, therefore, normal to not try in anything school-related. I get it. It's so much more fun to be talking with friends, and it's so much easier to be on our phones. It also doesn't help that everything coming out of the teacher's mouth either isn't making sense or is just plain BORING. Those people around me weren't bad people, but I could see why they wouldn't pay attention in class or skip it altogether.</p>
        <p>I'm sure everyone wasn't like that - they just chose to present themselves that way to fit in with everyone else. I mean, that's why nerds get bullied and picked on right? Pretty soon, you start hearing things like "I hate school" or "I don't wanna do this s***" and murmurs of agreement everywhere you go.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, that type of student culture at my high school wasn't as harsh as I may have made it seem. Or I was just at the "wrong" place at the "wrong" time. Either way, I thought I left it behind coming into college. Selfishly, I thought to myself, "I won't have to deal with those type of people ever again". But here I am now, at a high school helping students I so selfishly wanted to avoid. Ouch.</p>
        <p>Again, they weren't bad people - I just didn't belong with them.</p>
        <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm sitting in chair in a high school classroom. A normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. I still don't feel quite right in it, but, this time, I feel slightly more comfortable. Because next to me, is another student who, although he doesn't like school, is at least willing to try.</p>
        <p>When I get out of my chair, I look back, and I see something strange in the corner of my eye. The chair looks different. Then I blink and everything is back to normal. I'm probably imagining things. After all, I probably would've noticed if I was sitting on a cushion the whole time.</p>

      <h4 class="title">Unnoticed</h4>
      <h6 class="date">May 1, 2018</h6>
      <p>There's a mysterious attractiveness to her. It's not a "love at first sight" sort of thing, but I can't look away no matter how hard I try. I manage to break my gaze once but it quickly makes its way back to her. She hasn't noticed me yet. And part of me is hoping that she won't.</p>
      <p>The other part of me is desperately screaming at her, trying to get her to look at me. Deep down, that part of me knows it won't work though. Not just the screaming. But the relationship as well.</p>
      <p>So the shy side overpowers the longing one, and I remain where I am. She never looks at me once. I feel kind of relieved, but a little wounded at the same time. I won't have to embarrass myself this time. Then her face blends into the crowd and becomes unnoticeable, the same way my face probably looks to her. I didn't know if I was ready for her to leave yet, but it was already too late.</p>
      <p>As I'm walking, I play out scenarios in my head of me approaching her and imagine how "suave" I would be in each one. My thoughts are interrupted by a finger tap on my shoulder. I look behind me, expecting no one in particular, and see her face. She's looking at me. Smiling at me. Noticing me.</p>

      <h4 class="title">They Say Teaching Is The Best Way To Learn</h4>
      <h6 class="date">May 3, 2018</h6>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I read Habits of Mind: An Organizing Principle for Mathematics Curricula by Al Cuoco, E. Paul Goldenberg, and June Mark. They touched upon a point - or rather, centered their argument around a point - that I was slowly experiencing, but never really realized until now: math isn't really about knowing all the different shapes and their geometric properties or knowing how to do complex calculations with a ton of variables and symbols. Math is about knowing how to do.</p>
      <button id="more_learning_math_button" onclick="learningMath()">Read more</button>
      <div id="more_learning_math">
        <p>Being a good student - or, perhaps not mutually exclusive, a blind and naive one - I never questioned what I was learning. I never asked myself, "Why do we have to know how to complete the square?" or "Why do we need to learn how to prove two triangles are congruent?". I just did them. Sure, some things are useful, like knowing how to calculate area and volume or knowing about derivatives (our world is the result of recognizing and solving optimization problems), but when and how often am I ever going to be in a situation where it would be useful to know that sin(&pi;/6) is 1/2?</p>
        <p>I've been asked by high school students before, "Do you need to know this for college?" My simple answer: "No." My more accurate but perhaps not the most motivating answer: "No, I haven't done this in forever." I already know what they're thinking, even if they don't say it out loud - "Then why do we need to learn this?" My high school self would've just said, "I don't know, just do it and get it over with."</p>
        <p>For the past few days, the class for which I've been tutoring has been learning about how to prove triangles are congruent. Admittedly, I don't remember much about it. But I never realized how similar doing geometry proofs was to doing higher-level math proofs for theorems. You start with what you're given, use your knowledge to find out what else you can claim, and make your conclusions.</p>
        <p>A student asked for help proving triangles are congruent. I had no idea how to do it. I immediately started thinking, "Well, what do we know from the picture?", "Can we say this?", "Will that help?". That's when I realized that those were the types of questions they should've been asking themselves. Learning how to prove triangles are congruent isn't about making sure you know (and remember) about the side-side-side postulate or side-angle-side postulate. It's about looking at the picture and using what you know to work towards the last step in the proof. In other words, it's about learning how to think and problem solve.</p>
        <p>"Do you need to know this for college?" Probably not, at least to pass your classes anyways. What's more important, I now have learned, is realizing you're learning about critical thinking - not about triangles.</p>

      <h4 class="title">Going Against The Grain</h4>
      <h6 class="date">May 5, 2018</h6>
      <p>Have you ever held something in your hands and you know what to do with it, but you don't do it because you tell yourself you don't know how to do it?</p>
      <p>Ok, so maybe I really didn't know how to cut hair - much less my own - but I knew what I had to do with the clippers in my hand. Yet, I never put them against my head. I looked back and forth between the instructions and my head in the mirror, hoping that something in my brain would just "click" and I would suddenly know what to do. The instructions were clear enough: split your head into three sections and, starting at the bottom, cut against the grain. Yet, I never put them against my head.</p>
      <button id="more_haircut_button" onclick="haircut()">Read more</button>
      <div id="more_haircut">
        <p>Ironically, my somewhat-irrational fear of messing up was preventing me from cutting. Ironic, because I wanted to have an "ugly" haircut. Somewhat-irrational, because it would grow back anyways. However, the only thought going through my mind was, "Once I cut my hair off, there's no undoing it". That idea gripped my hand and held it in place, as if it was blackmailing my brain. Telling me, "Don't do it, or else".</p>
        <p>But my brain isn't always rational.</p>
        <p>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh wow. I did it. I actually did it. It wasn't that bad. And it was so liberating! I felt as if I had broken off chains I didn't even know were weighing me down. In a way, I was free - free from the expectations of getting a good haircut. Free from my boring, generic, could-be-anybody look. Free from myself. I changed to a smaller guard and kept going.</p>
        <p>I actually didn't cut off a lot of hair. But it was enough to make people stare at me and wonder what happened. Which was what I wanted, in a way. Not to be some weirdo with a horrible sense of fasion or no sense of self-respect. But to be someone different.</p>
        <p>Someone new.</p>
