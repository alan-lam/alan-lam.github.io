          <h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>
          <p>Let's suppose you're trying to break into someone's phone. You know the password is 4 digits and you know what the 4 digits are, but you don't know the order of the digits. What do you do?</p>
          <p>You would probably try every single possible order of digits until you find the right one. Let's say the digits are `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`. Well, some of the possible orders are:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`</p>
            <p>`2`,`3`,`1`,`4`</p>
            <p>`4`,`1`,`3`,`2`</p>
            <p>`2`,`4`,`1`,`3`</p>
            <p>`3`,`2`,`4`,`1`</p>
          </div>
          <p>All the possible orders are called permutations. <strong>Given a set `S` of objects, a permutation of `S` is a way to put all elements of `S` in order</strong>.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>For `S = {1,2,3}`, all the permutations are:</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`1,2,3`</p>
              <p>`1,3,2`</p>
              <p>`2,1,3`</p>
              <p>`2,3,1`</p>
              <p>`3,1,2`</p>
              <p>`3,2,1`</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Suppose you're lucky and you do end up getting the right order for the password. Suppose you're unlucky and it happens to be the very last possible order left to try. How many orderings did you have to go through?</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>`n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1`</p>
            <p>`5! = 5*4*3*2*1`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Theorem: If `S` has `n gt 0` elements, then there are `n!` permutations of the elements in `S`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="permutationproof">
              <p>For a set of size `1`, there's only `1` way to order all the elements. `1 = 1!` so the statement holds for the base case</p>
              <p>Suppose the statement is true for a set of size `n`</p>
              <p>Let `S` be a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>We could pick any random element of `S` and put that in the first spot</p>
              <p>Now, `S` has `n` elements</p>
              <p>Since the statement is true for a set of size `n`, there are `n!` ways to order the remaining elements in `S`</p>
              <p>There were `n+1` choices for the random element in the first spot</p>
              <p>So the total number of ways to order the elements is `(n+1)*n! = (n+1)!`</p>
            </div>
            <a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#permutationproof">Proof</a>
            <p>Intuitively, there are `n` choices for the first digit, `n-1` choices for the second digit, `n-2` choices for the third digit, ..., all the way down to `1` choice for the last digit</p>
            <p>So there are `n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*1 = n!` ways to order the elements</p>
          </div>
          <p>Which means you had to go through `4! = 24` orderings before getting the right password.</p>
          <h2 id="combinations">Combinations</h2>
          <p>For phone passwords, the order in which you type the digits matter. But what if the order didn't matter? How many ways would there be to order elements now?</p>
          <p>Let's suppose you're arranging flowers. You have `2` red flowers and `1` yellow flower. How many ways can we arrange them? Previously, we saw that if we have `n` elements, there are `n!` ways to arrange them. Here, we have `3` elements, so there are `3! = 6` ways to arrange them. All the possible orderings are:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`R RY`</p>
            <p>`R RY`</p>
            <p>`YR R`</p>
            <p>`YR R`</p>
            <p>`RYR`</p>
            <p>`RYR`</p>
          </div>
          <p>But some of the orderings are repeated. This is because the `2` red flowers are technically different flowers, but the order in which they appear doesn't matter; the result is the same. So we have to divide out the commonalities. In this case, since there are `2` red flowers and, therefore, `2!` ways to order them, we divide the total number of ways to arrange all the elements by `2!`.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`(3!)/(2!) = 3`</p>
            <p>`R RY`</p>
            <p>`YR R`</p>
            <p>`RYR`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>If we have `10` red flowers and `5` yellow flowers, then the total number of ways to arrange them is</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`(15!)/(10!5!)`</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>If we have `r` red flowers, `y` yellow flowers, and `b` blue flowers, then the total number of ways to arrange them is</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`((r+y+b)!)/(r!y!b!)`</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Theorem: Say we have `n` objects which have one of `k` different types. Objects of the same type are considered identical. Label the types with numbers `1,2,...,k` and let `a_i` be the number of objects of type `i`. Then the number of ways to arrange the `n` objects is `(n!)/(a_1!a_2!...a_k!)`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p><strong>The multinomial coefficient is `((n),((a_1,a_2,...,a_k))) = (n!)/(a_1!a_2!...a_k!)`</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The binomial coefficient is the multinomial coefficient for `k=2`, which is `((n),((a_1,a_2)))`</strong>. It's often denoted by `((n),(a_1))` instead because we know `a_2 = n - a_1`</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="words">Words</h2>
          <p>Sometimes, it's easier to count things by using some sort of encoding.</p>
          <p><strong>A word is a finite ordered sequence whose entries are drawn from some set `A`, called the alphabet. The length of a word is the number of entries it has</strong>. Entries may be repeated. An empty sequence `O/` is a word of length `0`</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>The alphabet is `A = {a,b}`</p>
            <p>The words of length `le 2` are:</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`O/`</p>
              <p>`a`</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>Theorem: If `|A| = n`, then the number of words of length `k` is `n^k`</p>
            <p>Since there are `n` choices for each spot and there are `k` spots, there are `ubrace(n*n*...*n)_k = n^k` words of length `k`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>`[n] = {1,2,...,n}`</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>The number of subsets of `[n]` is `2^n`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="subsetwordproof">
              <p>Let `S sube [n]`</p>
              <p>Define a word `w_s` of length `n` in the alphabet `{0,1}` as follows:</p>
              <p>Let `i in [n]`</p>
              <p>If `i in S`, then the `i^(th)` entry of `w_s = 1`</p>
              <p>If `i notin S`, then the `i^(th)` entry of `w_s = 0`</p>
              <p>We have a function `f:{text(subset ) S text( of ) [n]} rarr {text(word of length ) n text( in alphabet ) {0,1}}`</p>
              <p>We can define another function `g:{text(words of length ) n text( in ) {0,1}} rarr {text(subset of ) [n]}` to be the inverse of `f`</p>
              <p>This means `f` is bijective</p>
              <p>So `|{text(subsets of )[n]}| = |{text(words of length )n text( in ) {0,1}}| = 2^n`</p>
              <div class="box">
                <p>If `n = 5` and `S = {1,3,4}`, then the word associated with `S` is `10110`</p>

            </div>
            <a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#subsetwordproof">Proof</a>
            <p>The general idea is that any element is either in `S` or not in `S`</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>How many pairs of subsets `S,T sube [n]` satisfy `S sube T`?</p>
            <p>A similar idea applies here: any element is</p>
            <ol>
              <li>in `S` and in `T`</li>
              <li>not in `S` but in `T`</li>
              <li>not in `S` and not in `T`</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are `3` choices for each of the `n` elements, so there are `3^n` total possibilities</p>
            <p>We could define a function `f:{text(pairs of subsets ) S,T sube [n] s.t. S sube T} rarr {text(words of length ) n text( in ) {text(in ) S, text( not in ) S text( but in ) T, text( not in ) S text( and not in ) T}}`</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>For `n ge k` where `n` is a nonnegative integer, the <strong>falling factorial is `(n)_k = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-k+1)`</strong></p>

            <p>Theorem: If `|A| = n ge k`, then there are `(n)_k` words of length `k` in `A` that do not have repeating entries</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="repeatingentriesproof">
              <p>Let `sigma = a_1a_2...a_ka_(k+1)...a_n` be a permutation of `A`</p>
              <p>The first `k` entries make up a word with no repeating entries</p>
              <p>Since there are `n!` permutations, we have `n!` words with no repeating entries</p>
              <p>But there are repeated words since the last `(n-k)` entries can be ordered in any way</p>
              <p>So there are `(n!)/((n-k)!) = (n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)*(n-k)!)/((n-k)!) = (n)_k` words with no repeating entries</p>
              <p>For example, let `A = {1,2,3,4,5}` and `k=3`</p>
              <p>Let `sigma = 31254`</p>
              <p>The first `k` entries are `312`, which is a word of length `k` with no repeating entries</p>
              <p>So that is contained in `31254`</p>

          <p>Sometimes, counting problems are solved by looking at the number of ways to choose things. In the flower example, we can look at it as, "how many ways are there to choose `r` red flowers and `y` yellow flowers?"</p>
          <p>We saw earlier that the number of subsets of a set of size `n` is `2^n`. We could look at how many of those subsets are of size `k`.</p>

            <p>Theorem: The number of `k`-element subsets of `[n]` is `((n),(k)) = (n!)/(k!(n-k)!)`</p>

              <p>We can associate subsets of `[n]` with words of length `n` in `{0,1}`</p>
              <p>The number of `k`-element subsets of `[n]` is the number of words of length `n` in `{0,1}` that have exactly `k` `1`'s</p>
              <p>For such words, there are `k` ways to arrange the `1`'s and `n-k` ways to arrange the `0`'s</p>
              <p>Which gives us `(n!)/(k!(n-k)!) = ((n),(k))`</p>
