            <p>Theorem: There are `2^n` subsets of a set of size `n`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="subsetinduction">
              <p>Let `P(n)` be the statement that there are `2^n` subsets of a set of size `n`</p>
              <p>For a set with `0` elements, the only subset is `O/`, which is consistent with `2^0 = 1` so `P(0)` is true</p>
              <p>Suppose `P(n)` is true. Want to show `P(n+1)` is true, i.e. there are `2^(n+1)` subsets of a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Let `S` be a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Fix any `x in S` and consider `S' = S\\{x}`</p>
              <p>Since `S'` has `n` elements, there are `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>Every subset of `S` either contains `x` or it doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that don't contain `x` are in `S'`, which has `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that don't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that do contain `x` can be obtained by adding `x` to each subset that doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that do contain `x`</p>
              <p>The total number of subsets of `S` is the number of subsets containing `x` plus the number of the subsets not containing `x`</p>

          <p>Let's suppose you're arranging flowers. You have `2` red flowers and `1` yellow flower. How many ways can we arrange them? Previously, we saw that if we have `n` elements, there are `n!` ways to arrange them. Here, we have `3` elements, so there are `3! = 6` ways to arrange them. All the possible orderings are:</p>

So we have to divide out the commonalities. In this case, since there are `2` red flowers and, therefore, `2!` ways to order them, we divide the total number of ways to arrange all the elements by `2!`.</p>

            <p>Intuitively, a multiset is a weak composition that is written out. Since the parts of the weak composition have to add up to `n`, there are `n` elements in the multiset. So the formula for an `n`-element multiset applies here.</p>
            <div class="box">

          <div class="box">
            <p>How many ways can we distribute all the candy so that no child is candyless?</p>
            <p>First, we can give each child `1` piece of candy</p>
            <p>Now, we have `16` pieces of candy leftover which can be distributed in any way</p>
            <p>So this can be seen as a weak composition of `16` into `4` parts</p>
            <p>`((19),(16))`</p>
            <p>Since each child has at least `1` candy, this is also a composition of `20` into `4` parts</p>

          <div class="box">

            <p>Generalizing the previous example, there is a bijection between compositions of `n` into `k` parts and weak compositions of `n-k` into `k` parts</p>

              <p>The possible number of parts for a composition of `n` ranges from `k = 1` to `k = n`</p>
