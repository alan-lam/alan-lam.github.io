          <p>Functions. Why study them? Why are they so important that we devote a field of math to studying them?</p>
          <h2>To Fetch a Cup of Water</h2>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Jack runs up a hill and then back down to his starting point for a total distance of `12` kilometers. He runs `9` km/hr uphill and `16` km/hr downhill and uses the same straight path in both directions. What is Jack's distance from his starting point at any given moment during his run?</p>
          </div>
          <p>For whatever reason, we want to know his distance from his starting point <em>at any given moment</em>. In kilometers, no less. (Perhaps this has some location tracking applications?) For me, the words "at any given moment" is a tip-off that we should come up with a function so that we could plug in <em>any</em> time and get his distance.</p>
          <p>We are probably familiar with the formula `d = rt` (distance = rate * time). We're looking for distance. We have his rates. This looks like it'll be helpful.</p>
          <p>Since he has different rates going up and down the hill, we'll probably need `2` equations to model this situation. One for going up the hill. One for going down the hill.</p>
          <p>Let's let `t` be the time in minutes. When he's going up the hill, he's going at a rate of `9` km/hr. Since `t` is the number of minutes, we'll convert the rate so it becomes `9/60` km/min. Now we can come up with the equation `d = 9/60 t`.</p>
          <p>Going down the hill is almost the same. It seems like the equation would be `d = 16/60 t`. Let's combine these two equations into a piecewise function.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`d(t) = {(9/60 t), (16/60 t):}`</p>
          </div>
          <p>So if we wanted to find the distance after `1` minute, we would plug in `1` for `t` and get ... wait. Which equation do we use?</p>
          <p>Thinking about our situation, it takes him `40` minutes to run up the hill. `(6 \ text(km))/(x min) = (9 \ text(km))/(60 min) => x = 40.` (If it takes him `60` minutes to run `9` km, then it takes him `40` minutes to run `6` km, which is the length of the distance from the bottom to the top of the hill.) So at `1` minute, he's still running up the hill, which means we want to use the first equation. In order to clarify which equation we should use, we should set bounds on `t` for our piecewise function.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`d(t) = {(9/60 t \ \ \ 0 <= t < 40), (16/60 t):}`</p>
          </div>
          <p>So for what values of `t` do we use the second equation? `(6 \ text(km))/(x min) = (16 \ text(km))/(60 min) => x = 22.5`. It takes Jack `22.5` minutes to run `6` km if he takes `60` minutes to run `16` km. But keep in mind that at this point, he's already run for `40` minutes. So our function becomes:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`d(t) = {(9/60 t \ \ \ 0 <= t < 40), (16/60 t \ \ \ 40 <= t < 62.5):}`</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is almost correct. When Jack is at the top of the hill, he <em>should be `6` km away from the starting point</em>. But `16/60 * 40` doesn't give us `6`. We have to modify the second equation a bit.</p>
          <p>`d(t) = 16/60 t` measures how much distance Jack has covered, not his distance from the starting point. To find that, we have to subtract the distance he's covered from the total distance.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/calculus/distance.gif">
          </div>
          <p>So our second equation becomes `d(t) = 6 - 16/60 t`. But plugging in `t = 40` still doesn't give us `6`. That's because we also have to take into account that he's been running for `40` minutes already at this point. So we have to subtract `40` from `t`. One way to look at it is that we have to find a way to make sure that when we plug in `t = 40`, we get `6`. Our final answer becomes:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`d(t) = {(9/60 t \ \ \ 0 <= t < 40), (6 - 16/60 (t - 40) \ \ \ 40 <= t < 62.5):}`</p>
          </div>
          <p>#modelingreality</p>
          <h2>Expectation of Linearity</h2>
          <p>In the previous problem, we came up with a function `d` that measured Jack's distance from the starting point. In a sense, `d` is a position function. We also assumed that Jack was running at a constant rate, i.e. a constant velocity. It turns out if the average velocity of `d` is the same on any interval, then `d` is a linear function.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/calculus/distance_graph.png">
          <p>Looking at the graph of `d(t) = 9/60 t`, for `0 <= t < 40`, it does look like a line. But why?</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Suppose `s: RR -> RR` is a position function. If the average velocity of `s` is the same on any interval, then `s` is a linear function.</p>
            <p>Let `t_f, t_i in RR` (where `t_f != t_i`) be times and let `s(t_f), s(t_i) in RR` be the positions at those times.</p>
            <p>Average velocity = `text(change in position)/text(change in time) = (s(t_f) - s(t_i))/(t_f-t_i)`.</p>
            <p>Since it is the same on any interval, we can say `(s(t_f) - s(t_i))/(t_f-t_i) = c` for some constant `c in RR`.</p>
            <p>Then `s(t_f) = c(t_f - t_i) + s(t_i)`</p>
            <p>Since that is of the form `y = mx + b` (where `y = s(t_f), m = c, x = (t_f - t_i), b = s(t_i)`), it is a linear function.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>Gaining Popularity</h2>
          <p>Suppose we want to predict the population of a certain city. How would we do that? We could collect data on the population from past years and use that to make a prediction.</p>
          <div class="math flex">
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td>year</td>
                <td>population</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`1998`</td>
                <td>`67.38`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`1999`</td>
                <td>`69.13`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`2000`</td>
                <td>`70.93`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`2001`</td>
                <td>`72.78`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`2002`</td>
                <td>`74.68`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`2003`</td>
                <td>`76.63`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>`2004`</td>
                <td>`78.63`</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>When given a sequence of numbers, it's often insightful to see if there's a pattern. These numbers are increasing each year. Maybe they're increasing by the same number each year?</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`69.13 - 67.38 = 1.75`</p>
            <p>`70.93 - 69.13 = 1.8`</p>
            <p>`72.78 - 70.93 = 1.85`</p>
            <p>`74.68 - 72.78 = 1.9`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Well, they're not increasing by the same number each year, but it still looks there's a pattern here. Without doing the calculation, it seems that `76.63 - 74.68` is likely equal to `1.95`. And obviously, `78.63 - 76.63 = 2`. Using this pattern, we could predict the population at a certain year. For example, the population in `2005` is probably `80.68`.</p>
          <h4>Sequence of Differences</h4>
          <p>By subtracting the populations, we were looking at the sequence of first differences. By looking at the pattern in those differences, we were looking at the sequence of second differences.</p>
          <p>Let `{a_n}_(n >= 1) = a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` be a sequence. Then we can define `{b_n}_(n >= 1)` to be the sequence of first differences where `b_n = a_(n+1) - a_n`.</p>
          <p>In the previous example, `{a_7} = {67.38, 69.13, 70.93, 72.78, 74.68, 76.63, 78.63}` and `{b_6} = {1.75, 1.8, 1.85, 1.9, 1.95, 2}`.</p>
          <p>The sequence of second differences would be defined as `{c_n}_(n >= 1)` where `c_n = b_(n+1) - b_n`.</p>
          <p>In the previous example, `{c_5} = {0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05}`.</p>
          <p>So what do sequences of differences have to do with functions? Well, it turns out that if the sequence of first differences of a sequence is nonzero and constant, then that sequence is linear, i.e. it can be represented by a linear function. If the sequence of second differences of a sequence is nonzero and constant, then that sequence is quadratic, i.e. it can be represented by a quadratic function.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>A sequence `{a_n}` is linear, i.e. `a_n = An + B` (where `A != 0`) if and only if its sequence of first differences is a nonzero constant sequence.</p>
            <p>Proof:</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseFirstDifference">
              <p>`(=>)`</p>
              <p>Suppose `{a_n}` is linear</p>
              <p>Then `a_n = An + B` where `A != 0`</p>
              <p>So `a_(n+1) = A(n+1) + B = An + A + B`</p>
              <p>The sequence of first differences is `a_(n+1) - a_n`</p>
              <p>`a_(n+1) - a_n = (An + A + B) - (An + B) = A`</p>
              <p>Since `A` is a nonzero constant, the sequence of first differences is a nonzero constant sequence</p>
              <p>`(lArr)`</p>
              <p>Suppose the sequence of first differences is a nonzero constant sequence</p>
              <p>Then for `n >= 1`, `a_(n+1) - a_n = c` for some `c != 0`. So we have:</p>
              <p>`a_2 - a_1 = c`</p>
              <p>`a_3 - a_2 = c`</p>
              <p>`a_4 - a_3 = c`</p>
              <p>`vdots`</p>
              <p>`a_n - a_(n-1) = c`</p>
              <p>Adding them up, we get `a_n - a_1 = (n-1)c`</p>
              <p>`=> a_n = cn - c + a_1`, which is of the form `y = mx + b` (where `y = a_n, m = c, x = n, b = -c + a_1`)</p>
              <p>So `{a_n}` is linear</p>
            </div>
            <a class="btn toggle-text" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFirstDifference"><span>Read more</span><span class="hidden">Read less</span></a>
          </div>
          <p>Going back to our population problem, it looks like the sequence of second differences are a nonzero constant sequence. That means our sequence can be represented by a quadratic function. So we can predict the population with the equation `P(t) = At^2 + Bt + C`, where `t` is the number of years after `1998`. We can use some values from the table to find out what `A`, `B`, and `C` are.</p>
          <p>When `t = 0`, the population is `67.38`. So `67.38 = A(0)^2 + B(0) + C => C = 67.38`</p>
          <p>When `t = 1`, the population is `69.13`. So `69.13 = A(1)^2 + B(1) + 67.38`</p>
          <p>When `t = 2`, the population is `70.93`. So `70.93 = A(2)^2 + B(2) + 67.38`</p>
          <p>We have a system of equations with `2` unknowns:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`69.13 = A + B + 67.38`</p>
            <p>`70.93 = 4A + 2B + 67.38`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Solving that system, we get `A = 0.025` and `B = 1.725`. Now that we know what `A`, `B`, and `C` are, we get our equation:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`P(t) = 0.025t^2 + 1.725t + 67.38`</p>
          </div>
          <p>For `t = 1, P(1) = 69.13`. For `t = 2, P(2) = 70.93`. For `t = 3, P(3) = 72.78`. So it looks like our function models the problem pretty well.</p>
