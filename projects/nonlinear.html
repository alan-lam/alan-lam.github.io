          <h1>Numerical Analysis: A Nonlinear Story</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Shortcut to this page: <a href="nonlinear.html">aln.netlify.com/nonlinear</a></p>
          <p>This is the nonlinear version of the <a href="lin_alg.html" target="_blank">linear algebra story</a>. The linear story was looking at how to solve problems of the form `Ax = b` i.e. `Ax - b = 0`, which is linear. This story looks at how to solve problems of the form `f(x) = g(x)` where `f(x), g(x)` are nonlinear. For example, they could be `x^2, x^3, cos(x), e^(x), ...`</p>
          <h2 id="numbersstore">A Numbers Store Stores Numbers</h2>
          <p>How does a computer store numbers? Vaguely, we could describe it as putting each digit in a space somewhere in the computer's memory. So `100` would need `3` spaces`color(red)(text(*))`. This seems like an easy and obvious idea until we get to numbers like `pi`, which has an infinite number of digits. Does this mean we need an infinite amount of memory to store `pi`? But computers don't have infinite memory, so what happens then?</p>
          <p>`color(red)(text(*)`Computers work in binary, so things are a little bit different than this.</p>
          <p><b>Computers store a number by keeping as much of it as it can, and then throwing away the rest.</b> So if a computer can only store at most `8` digits, then it would store `pi` as `3.1415926`. But complications arise when we're dealing with really big or really small numbers. For example, `0.00000000000000045` would be stored as `0.0000000`, which is just `0`. This is a problem because `0.00000000000000045` isn't equal to `0`, but it would be treated as such. A similar problem occurs for `1000000000000000`, which would be stored as `10000000`, which is much much smaller.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/comic_storing.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>This suggests needing a smarter way to represent the numbers. Enter, scientific notation. With scientific notation, we can represent `0.00000000000000045` as `0.45 xx 10^(-16)` and `1000000000000000` as `1 xx 10^15`. Then we would only need to store the `45` and the `-16` for `0.45 xx 10^(-16)`. And the `1` and the `15` for `1 xx 10^15`.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>In these examples, the `45` and the `1` are called the "mantissa" and the `-16` and the `15` are called the "exponents".</p>
            <p>Single-precision computers use 32 bits (4 bytes) to store a number:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>1 bit for the sign (to indicate whether the number is positive or negative)</p></li>
              <li><p>8 bits for the exponent</p></li>
              <li><p>23 bits for the mantissa</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Double-precision computers use 64 bits (8 bytes) to store a number:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>1 bit for the sign</p></li>
              <li><p>11 bits for the exponent</p></li>
              <li><p>52 bits for the mantissa</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Scientific notation helps make it easier to store numbers, but some complications <em>still</em> pop up. Consider a computer that can only store at most `3` digits in the mantissa. Let's say we wanted to store the number `0.002146`. In scientific notation, it would be `0.2146 xx 10^(-2)`, which has `4` digits in the mantissa. Our computer can only store `3` digits in the mantissa, so how should it be stored? There are 2 options: chopping and rounding.</p>
          <p>Under chopping, `0.2146 xx 10^(-2)` would become `0.214 xx 10^(-2)`. As the name implies, the rest of the digits (after the `3^(rd)`) are "chopped off". Under rounding, `0.2146 xx 10^(-2)` would become `0.215 xx 10^(-2)`.</p>
          <p>From this, we can see that what the computer stores isn't always going to be exactly equal to the original number. The version of the number that the computer stores can be denoted by `fl(x)`, where `x` is the original number.</p>
          <p>So the <b>difference between the original number and the stored number is going to be the error</b>. There are `2` types of errors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>absolute error ` = abs(x - fl(x))`</p></li>
            <li><p>relative error ` = abs(x - fl(x))/abs(x)`</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Errors are bad, but unavoidable. So it would be helpful to know how bad the relative error could be for any number we want to store.</p>
          <p>Let's say we want to store the number `x` (which is not `0`) on an `n`-digit chopping computer (a computer that stores at most `n` digits and uses the chopping method). Written in scientific notation,</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`x = +- 0.d_1\ d_2\ d_3\ ... xx 10^a`</p>
            <p>where `d_i` is the `i^(th)` digit of the mantissa of `x`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Since this computer uses chopping, it would only store the first `n` digits of the mantissa. Written in scientific notation,</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`fl(x) = +- 0.d_1\ d_2\ d_3\ ...\ d_n xx 10^a`</p>
          </div>
          <p>We want to compute the relative error, so we need `abs(x - fl(x))` and `abs(x)`.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`abs(x - fl(x)) = 0.ubrace(00...0)_n\ d_(n+1)\ d_(n+2)\ ... xx 10^a`</p>
            <p>`abs(x) = 0.d_1\ d_2\ d_3\ ... xx 10^a`</p>
            <p>relative error = `abs(x - fl(x))/abs(x) = (0.obrace(00...0)^n\ d_(n+1)\ d_(n+2)\ ... xx 10^a)/(0.d_1\ d_2\ d_3\ ... xx 10^a)`</p>
            <p>` = (0.obrace(00...0)^n\ d_(n+1)\ d_(n+2)\ ...)/(0.d_1\ d_2\ d_3\ ...)`</p>
          </div>
          <p>To find out the worst our error could be, we want to make it as large as possible. We do that by making the numerator as big as possible (by letting `d_(n+1) = d_(n+2) = ... = 9`) and making the denominator as small as possible (by letting `d_1 = 1` `color(red)(text(*))` and `d_2 = d_3 = ... = 0`).</p>
          <p>`color(red)(text(*))``d_1` cannot be `0` because of the way numbers are written in scientific notation. You wouldn't write something like `0.083 xx 10^3`; it would be `0.83 xx 10^2`.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`le (0.obrace(00...0)^(n-1)1color(red)(text(*)))/(0.100)`</p>
            <p>` = 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-2)1`</p>
            <p>` = 10^(-(n-1))`</p>
            <p>` = 10^(1-n)`</p>
          </div>
          <p>`color(red)(text(*))``0.999... = 1`</p>
          <p>So the relative error — which we can denote by `epsilon` — can be at most `10^(1-n)`. This is the largest error possible for an `n`-digit chopping computer.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>For an `n`-digit rounding computer, `epsilon = 1/2 * 10^(1-n)`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseRelErrorRoundBound">
              <p>Let `x = 0.d_1\ d_2\ ... xx 10^a` be a real number. Suppose `d_(n+1) lt 5`. Then `fl(x) = 0.d_1\ d_2\ ... d_n xx 10^a`</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>relative error = `abs(x - fl(x))/abs(x)`</p>
                <p>`= (0.obrace(0...0)^n\ d_(n+1)\ d_(n+2)\ ... xx 10^a)/(0.d_1\ d_2\ ... xx 10^a)`</p>

                <p>`le (0.obrace(0...0)^n49...)/(0.10...)`</p>
                <p>`= (0.obrace(0...0)^n5)/(0.1)`</p>
                <p>`= 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)5`</p>
                <p>`= 0.5 xx 10^(-(n-1))`</p>
                <p>`= 1/2 xx 10^(1-n)`</p>
              </div>
              <p>Now suppose `5 le d_(n+1) le 9`. Then `fl(x) = 0.d_1\ d_2\ ...\ d_n xx 10^a + 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1 xx 10^a`</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>relative error = `abs(x - fl(x))/abs(x)`</p>
                <p>`= abs(0.d_1\ d_2\ ...\ d_n\ d_(n+1)\ ... xx 10^a - 0.d_1\ ...\ d_n xx 10^a - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1 xx 10^a)/abs(0.d_1\ d_2\ ... xx 10^a)`</p>
                <p>`= abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n\ d_(n+1)\ ... - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1)/abs(0.d_1\ d_2\ ...)color(red)(text(*)`</p>
                <p>`le (0.obrace(0...0)^n5)/0.1`</p>
                <p>`= 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)5`</p>
                <p>`= 0.5 xx 10^(-(n-1))`</p>
                <p>`= 1/2 xx 10^(1-n)`</p>
              </div>
              <p>`color(red)(text(*))` Since `5 le d_(n+1) le 9`, we have:</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>`abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n5 - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1) = 0.obrace(0...0)^n5`</p>
                <p>`abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n6 - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1) = 0.obrace(0...0)^n4`</p>
                <p>`abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n7 - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1) = 0.obrace(0...0)^n3`</p>
                <p>`abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n8 - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1) = 0.obrace(0...0)^n2`</p>
                <p>`abs(0.obrace(0...0)^n9 - 0.obrace(0...0)^(n-1)1) = 0.obrace(0...0)^n1`</p>
              </div>
              <p>So `d_(n+1) = 5` (and `d_(n+2) = d_(n+3) = ... = 0`) gives us the biggest error possible.</p>
            </div>
            <a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseRelErrorRoundBound">Proof</a>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p><b>The story thus far:</b> When we're working with really small/large numbers, computers won't be able to store them exactly as they are. Computers get around this by storing them using scientific notation. But even then, some numbers have so many digits (e.g. `pi`) that computers still can't store them exactly as they are. So computers either round the number or chop the number so there are less digits to store. This means that computers store a modified version of the number (denoted `fl(x)`).</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="errorsinoperations">Errors in Arithmetic Operations</h2>
          <p>Let's suppose we wanted to add `0.42312` and `0.63546` on a `3`-digit rounding computer. First, the computer would store them as `0.423` and `0.635`. Then, the computer would add those two to get `1.058``color(red)(text(*))`. Since this is a `3`-digit rounding computer, it would say that the answer is `1.06`. In math notation:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`fl(fl(0.42312) + fl(0.63546)) = fl(0.423 + 0.635) = fl(1.058) = 1.06`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Notice how this differs from the actual answer, which is `1.05858`.</p>
          <p>`color(red)(text(*))` This is a `4`-digit number, but the computer can only store `3`-digit numbers. It turns out that computers temporarily store results of arithmetic operations using more digits if needed.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>For longer strings of operations, the computer performs the operations pairwise. For example:</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`x * y * z = color(red)((x * y)) * z`</p>
              <p>the computer does `x*y` first, then multiplies that with `z`</p>
              <p>`= fl(color(red)(fl(fl(x)*fl(y)))*fl(z))`</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We've established that there are errors in storing numbers. And performing operations with "wrong" numbers will lead to numbers that are "more wrong". But how much error could there be when doing arithmetic operations?</p>
          <p>Let's suppose we wanted to multiply two numbers, `x` and `y`. In the computer, they're stored as `fl(x)` and `fl(y)`. Well, we can write:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`fl(x) = x(1 + delta_1)`</p>
            <p>`fl(y) = y(1 + delta_2)`</p>
            <p>where `abs(delta_1)` and `abs(delta_2)` are the relative errors`color(red)(text(*))`</p>
          </div>
          <p>In words: `fl(text(some number))` is the actual value with some error attached to it.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>`color(red)(text(*))` Recall that the formula for relative error is `abs(fl(x)-x)/abs(x)`</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`fl(x) = x(1 + delta_1)`</p>
              <p>`=> fl(x) = x + xdelta_1`</p>
              <p>`=> fl(x) - x = xdelta_1`</p>
              <p>`=> (fl(x) - x)/x = delta_1`</p>
              <p>`=> abs(fl(x)-x)/abs(x) = abs(delta_1)`</p>
            </div>
            <p>so `abs(delta_1)` is the relative error (similarly for `abs(delta_2)`)</p>
          </div>
          <p>So multiplying those two values would result in:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`fl(fl(x)*fl(y))`</p>
            <p>`= fl(x(1+delta_1)*y(1+delta_2))`</p>
            <p>`= (x(1+delta_1)*y(1+delta_2))(1+delta_3)`</p>
            <p>`= xy(1 + delta)`</p>
            <p>where `abs(delta)` is the relative error</p>
            <p>and `(1 + delta) = (1 + delta_1)(1 + delta_2)(1 + delta_3)`</p>
            <p>`= 1 + delta_1 + delta_2 + delta_3 + delta_1delta_2 + delta_1delta_3 + delta_2delta_3 + delta_1delta_2delta_3`</p>
          </div>
          <p>So how big is the relative error?</p>
          <div class="math">

          <p>In the previous section, we defined `epsilon` to be the largest possible relative error. So all of these relative errors are smaller than `epsilon`, i.e. `abs(delta_1), abs(delta_2), abs(delta_3) le epsilon`</p>

          <p>Now, let's suppose we wanted to subtract two numbers `x` and `y`.</p>

            <p>Example: For `n = 5` (a `5`-digit rounding computer), let's subtract `x = 1` and `y = 1.00001`. (The exact solution is `1 - 1.00001 = -0.00001`)</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>Because of this, we want to minimize the number of arithmetic operations whenever possible. For example, `1 + x + x^2 + x^3` takes `6` operations to do (`3` additions, `3` multiplications). However, we could rewrite `1 + x + x^2 + x^3` as `1 + x(1 + x(1 + x))`, which only requires `5` operations (`3` additions, `2` multiplications). The number of operations saved writing polynomials in nested form increases as the number of polynomials increases.</p>

          <p><b>2) Catastrophic cancellation can occur when subtracting numbers</b>.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Consider the situation of trying to find the roots of a quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. Let's suppose `b` is positive and `a`, `c` are small so that `abs(-4ac)` is small. Then `x = (-b + sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a) ~~ (-b + sqrt(b^2))/(2a) = (-b + b)/(2a) = 0``color(red)(text(*))`, which leads to catastrophic cancellation. We could avoid this by rewriting `x` by multiplying it by `1`.</p>
            <p>`x = (-b + sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a) * (-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac)) = (b^2 - (b^2 - 4ac))/(2a(-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))) = (2c)/(-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))`. In this case, catastrophic cancellation is avoided.</p>
            <p>`color(red)(text(*))`It only equals `0` when the number of digits of `b` exceeds the number of digits the computer can store. After all, `sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ~~ sqrt(b^2)`.</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p>Catastrophic cancellation only occurs when the number of digits exceeds the number of digits of a number a computer can store. This is why everything is fine when doing something like `5 - 4.99999`.</p>

            <p><b>The story thus far:</b> Computers store modified versions of numbers. This means that the number the computer stores is "wrong". When we work with "wrong" numbers (e.g. add, multiply them), we're gonna get an answer that is even "more wrong". For multiplication, things aren't too bad. But for subtraction, we can get undesired results when the numbers we're subtracting are really close to each other.</p>

          <h2 id="solvingroots">Solving Nonlinear Equations: Roots</h2>
          <p>How do we solve something like `cos(x) = x`? Let's say we didn't have a calculator, so we can't find the exact answer. How can we find a (good) approximation? In general, how do we find an approximation for `f(x) = g(x)`?</p>
          <h3 id="rootofproblem">Getting to the Root of the Problem</h3>
          <p>One way is to change the equation to the form `f(x) = 0`. Then, finding the roots of `f(x)` will be the solutions. Of course, it isn't going to be obvious what the roots are just from looking at something like `cos(x) - x = 0`. But we can try to trap a root in a small interval (i.e. find a small interval between which a root lies).</p>
          <p>This can be done with an iterative algorithm. We start with a root trapped in a large interval and reduce the size of the interval at every step. But how do we find an interval in which there is a root? Without knowing this, we can't start the algorithm!</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/comic_bisection.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>We do this by using the <b>Intermediate Value Theorem, which says if `f` is a continuous function in `[a,b]`, then `f` assumes every value between `f(a)` and `f(b).`</b></p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/ivt_general.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>In this example, `f` achieves every value between the dotted lines between `a` and `b`.</p>
          <p>So how does this help us find roots? We can apply it to the situation where `f(a)` and `f(b)` have different signs (e.g. one is positive and the other is negative). <b>If `f(a)` and `f(b)` have different signs, then `f` has a root in `[a, b]`.</b></p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/ivt_root.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>Again, `f` achieves every value between the dotted lines between `a` and `b`. Here, the `x`-axis lies between the dotted lines, so it is guaranteed that `f` will cross the `x`-axis, i.e. `f(c) = 0` at some point `c` between `a` and `b`.</p>
          <p>This suggests that we start the algorithm by picking `a_0, b_0` such that `f(a_0), f(b_0)` have different signs (e.g. `f(a_0)` is positive and `f(b_0)` is negative).</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/root_algorithm_0.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>Now we have to reduce the size of the interval. We can split it in half; then, the root has to either be on the left half or the right half. So let's split it at `c_0` (the midpoint) and suppose that `f(c_0)` is positive.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/root_algorithm_0.5.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>Now we have two choices for what our new interval `[a_1, b_1]` could be: `[a_0, c_0]` or `[c_0, b_0]`. The IVT doesn't tell us if there's a root between `a_0` and `c_0`, but it does guarantee that there is a root between `c_0` and `b_0`. So the new interval `[a_1, b_1]` should be `[c_0, b_0]`.</p>
          <p>And this process of dividing the interval in half repeats until the interval is small enough.</p>
          <h4 id="errorbisection">Error of the Bisection Method</h4>
          <p>The thing is, we're looking for a number, but we end up with an interval (two numbers). So how do we get our answer? We could just pick some number between that interval. At this point, the interval is really small, so our approximation should be close to the actual solution. But how much error is there?</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/root_algorithm_n.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>Let's pick some number `d_n` and use that as our approximation. In this picture, there would be the most error if the actual solution was at `b_n`. In general,</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`abs(text(exact)-text(approximate)) = abs(r - d_n) le abs(b_n - a_n)`</p>
            <p>where `r` is the exact solution</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>This is because the worst error would occur when the approximation we pick is `a_n` and the actual solution is `b_n` (or vice versa).</p>
          </div>
          <p>We usually pick as our approximation the midpoint of `a_n` and `b_n`. That actually gives us a better approximation because the most error we could have then is half of the previous error. (This would be when the exact solution is either at `a_n` or at `b_n`.)</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/root_algorithm_error.jpg">
            <p>`abs(text(exact)-text(approximate)) = abs(r - c_n) le abs(b_n - a_n)/2`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>In general, `abs(r - d_n) le max(abs(d_n-a_n), abs(d_n-b_n))`.</p>
          </div>
          <p>So to summarize, the algorithm for finding a root of a polynomial is:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Start with an interval `[a_0,b_0]` where `f(a_0)` and `f(b_0)` have different signs</p></li>
            <li><p>Cut the interval in half at `c_0`, which is the midpoint of `[a_0,b_0]`</p></li>
            <li><p>Pick a new (smaller) interval such that either `f(a_0)` and `f(c_0)` have different signs or `f(c_0)` and `f(b_0)` have different signs</p></li>
            <li><p>Repeat the steps for that new (smaller) interval</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>As the steps suggest, the name of this algorithm is the <b>bisection method</b>.</p>
          <h4 id="convergencebisection">Convergence of the Bisection Method</h4>
          <p>The bisection method generates a sequence of approximations:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`{c_n}_(n=0)^(oo)`</p>
            <p>where `c_n = (a_n + b_n)/2`</p>
          </div>
          <p>If the actual solution is `r`, then what we want to say is that `color(blue)(lim_(n->oo) c_n = r)`. In words, the more times we do the algorithm, the more approximations we will get and the closer those approximations will be to the actual solution `r`.</p>
          <p>Another way to say that is that the difference (i.e. error) between the approximation we get and the actual solution gets closer and closer to `0`. Generally, it might not be guaranteed to happen, but for the bisection method, it is true that the more times we do the algorithm, the closer it will get to `0`.</p>
          <p>Previously, we found that `abs(r - c_n) le abs(b_n - a_n)/2`. Well that means `abs(r - c_0) le abs(b_0 - a_0)/2`. And also, `abs(r - c_1) le abs(b_1 - a_1)/2`.</p>
          <p>But what is `abs(b_1 - a_1)`? Thinking back to the steps of the algorithm, `[a_1,b_1]` represented the new interval after splitting `[a_0,b_0]` in half. So `[a_1,b_1]` is really half of `[a_0,b_0]`. Which means `abs(b_1 - a_1) = abs(b_0 - a_0)/2`.</p>
          <p>Putting all that together, `abs(r - c_1) le abs(b_1 - a_1)/2 = (abs(b_0 - a_0)/2)/2 = 1/2^2 (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
          <p>Generalizing that idea, we can see that:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`abs(r - c_0) le 1/2^1 (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
            <p>`abs(r - c_1) le 1/2^2 (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
            <p>`abs(r - c_2) le 1/2^3 (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
            <p>`abs(r - c_3) le 1/2^4 (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
            <p>`vdots`</p>
            <p>`abs(r - c_n) le 1/2^(n+1) (b_0 - a_0)`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Now, as `n` gets larger and larger (i.e. as we do more steps of the algorithm), the right-hand side gets smaller and smaller. When `n` goes to `oo`, the right-hand side goes to `0`.</p>
          <p>This proves that what we want to say is true: `color(blue)(lim_(n->oo) abs(r - c_n) = 0 => lim_(n->oo)c_n = r)`</p>
          <p>When this happens, we say that the bisection method <em>converges</em>.</p>
          <p>So in theory, the error gets really small when `n` is large. But how large should `n` be? How many times should we keep dividing intervals in half until we get a satisfactory answer?</p>
          <p>If we know that the worst error is `1/2^(n+1) (b_0 - a_0)`, then we can decide how small the error could be.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Note that the error bound is dependent only on `a_0`, `b_0`, and `n`. We can already figure out how much error there will be without even knowing what `f(x)` is.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Ex: Let's say the starting interval is `[-1,3]` and that we want the error to be no bigger than `10^(-12)`.</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`(3-(-1))/(2^(n+1)) le 10^(-12)`</p>
              <p>`4/(2^(n+1)) le 1/10^(12)`</p>
              <p>`4*10^12 le 2^(n+1)`</p>
              <p>`log_2(4*10^12) le n+1`</p>
              <p>`n >= log_2(4*10^(12))-1 ~~ 41`</p>
            </div>
            <p>So if we do the bisection method for `41` steps, then the approximation we end up with will have an error of no more than `10^(-12)`.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>There are other procedures for deciding when to stop without using error bounds.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>We could stop when `abs(c_n - c_(n-1))` is small enough. In this case, we would be getting approximations that are unchanging because the error is so small. For example, if we got `{..., 0.98757, 0.98754, 0.98751, 0.98751, 0.98751, 0.98751}`, then we could be pretty sure that `0.98751` is a good approximation.</p></li>
              <li><p>We could stop when `abs(f(c_n))` is small enough. In this case, `abs(f(c_n))` would be really close to `0`, which is what we wanted in the first place (because we're looking for roots).</p></li>
              <li><p>We could stop when the algorithm takes too long or is not converging. This could happen for general algorithms (not the bisection method).</p></li>

Of course, a computer can do it almost instantly, but it takes more time to compute powers and roots than additions and divisions. So we can measure the speed of the bisection method by counting how many times we compute `f(x)`.</p>
          <p>In the code above, we're calcuating `f(a)` and `f(c)` every iteration. That's `2` costly operations. It turns out we can reduce it to only `1` costly operation per iteration if we store their values.</p>

          <p>We only need to calculate `f(a)` once at the beginning to use IVT. After that, `a` becomes `c`. At this point, we've also already calculated `f(c)`, so when we're trying to find new intervals, we don't need to calculate `f(c)` again.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Let's look at the bisection method without the code. Let's assume that to find `c_0`, we have to first determine whether `f(a_0)` and `f(b_0)` have opposite signs. Then to find `c_1` we have to compute `f(c_0)` and so on.</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`c_0`: `2` total function evaluations so far (`f(a_0)` and `f(b_0)`)</p>

              <p>`c_n`: `n+2` function evaluations</p>
            </div>
            <p>The `2` function evaluations come from using the IVT to ensure that the root is in between the intervals.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Some details regarding the bisection method:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>If `f(a)` and `f(c)` are both really large, then it's possible that multiplying them together results in a number that is too large for the computer to store. Then, we would get errors like we saw in the previous section. To avoid this, we could define a function called `sign(f(x)) = {(1 if f(x) > 0),(-1 if f(x) lt 0),(0 if f(x) = 0):}`. Then we could check if `sign(f(a)) != sign(f(c))` instead of multiplying them.</p></li>
              <li><p>It might sound like a good idea to check if `f(c_n) = 0` to stop the algorithm early. That would mean that in doing our algorithm, we hit on the <em>exact</em> root. The chances of that happening are virtually `0` (imagine marking `sqrt(2)` <em>exactly</em> on a a number line). The bisection method will converge anyway, so checking that is an extra costly operation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Like with the first point, it's possible that when calculating `c = (a+b)/2`, adding `a` and `b` results in a number too large to store. We can avoid this by calculating `c = a + (b-a)/2`. Note that `a + (b-a)/2 = (a + b)/2`.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p><b>The story thus far:</b> Now we're looking at how to actually solve problems like `f(x) = g(x)`. One way is to rearrange the equation so that we get `f(x) - g(x) = 0` (for simplicity, we generalize it to `f(x) = 0`). Then the task is to find the roots/zeros of `f(x)`. One way to find a root is to start with a big interval in which the root is guaranteed to lie. Then we repeatedly make the interval smaller and smaller until it's really close to the root.</p>

          <p>Another method we could use is Newton's method. In this method, we use tangent lines to approximate the root.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The idea is to start at an initial guess `x_0` and repeatedly draw tangent lines until we (hopefully) get close to the root.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Using the point-slope formula for the equation of a line, we can get the equation of the tangent line at `x_0`:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)`</p>
            <p>`y = f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + f(x_0)`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Our goal is to get `y = 0`, so we have:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`0 = f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + f(x_0)`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Solving for `x`, we get:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`x = x_0 - f(x_0)/(f'(x_0))`</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is the intuition behind the iterative formula for Newton's method:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n))`</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>There are some cases where Newton's method won't work.</p>
            <div class="math">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/newton_farther.jpg">
              <p>Here, each approximation results in a tangent line that just keeps going to the right.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/newton_bounce.jpg">
              <p>Here, the approximations will just keep bouncing back and forth between `x_0` and `x_1`.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/newton_parallel.jpg">
              <p>Here, the tangent line doesn't cross the `x`-axis, so we can't get an approximation.</p>
            </div>
            <p>So unlike the bisection method, Newton's method won't always work. However, it's still worth looking at Newton's method, because it turns out that it is generally faster than the bisection method.</p>

          <h4 id="errornewton">Error of Newton's Method</h4>
          <div class="box">
            <p>A Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum.</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`f(x) = f(a) + (f'(a))/(1!)(x-a) + (f''(a))/(2!)(x-a)^2 + (f'''(a))/(3!)(x-a)^3 + ...`</p>
              <p>`f(x) = sum_(n=0)^(oo) (f^(n)(a))/(n!)(x-a)^(n)`</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>To look at the error, we need an equation with `abs(x_(n+1) - r)`. Since `x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n))`, we need `x_n`, `f(x_n)`, and `f'(x_n)` to get `x_(n+1)`. We can get those `3` parts by looking at the Taylor series expansion of `f`.</p>
          <p>Notice that the first `2` terms of the Taylor series are the equation of a line for `f(x)` (and thus, are a linear approximation of `f(x)`). Since we're looking at approximations using lines, we'll consider the first `2` terms and collect the rest of the terms as some error.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`f(x) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(x-x_n) + (f''(xi_n))/2(x-x_n)^2`</p>
            <p>for some `xi_n` between `x` and `x_n`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Since we're interested in finding the root of `f(x)`, we can use `x = r` where `r` is a root to get:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`0 = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(r-x_n) + (f''(xi_n))/2(r-x_n)^2`</p>
            <p>`r = x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n)) - (f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n))(r-x_n)^2`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Well, `x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n)) = x_(n+1)` from the iterative formula for Newton's method, so we have:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`r = x_(n+1) - (f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n))(r-x_n)^2`</p>
            <p>`x_(n+1)-r = (f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n))(r-x_n)^2`</p>
          </div>
          <p>Then, we can let `e_n = x_n - r` be the error between the approximation and the root (so `e_(n+1) = x_(n+1)-r`).</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`e_(n+1) = (f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n))(e_n)^2`</p>
          </div>
          <p><b>This means that the error between our `(n+1)^(st)` approximation and the root is roughly equal to the square of the error between the `n^(th)` approximation and the root. So if the error was small for the `n^(th)` approximation, the error will be even smaller for the `(n+1)^(st)` approximation.</b></p>
          <div class="box">
            <ul>
              <li><p>If `f'(x_n) = 0` (the slope of the tangent line is horizontal), then we get a `0` in the denominator. This explains one of the cases where Newton's method doesn't work mentioned earlier.</p></li>
              <li><p>If `f''(xi_n) = oo` (the second derivative of `f` doesn't exist), then we get really large error.</p>

          <h4 id="speednewton">Speed of Newton's Method</h4>
          <p>The iterative formula for Newton's method is `x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n))`. From this, we can see that it requires `2` function evaluations per iteration. The bisection method required `2` function evaluations at the beginning, but then it only required `1` function evaluation per iteration. <b>This means that Newton's method does roughly twice as many function evaluations per iteration as the bisection method.</b> Doing more function evaluations means that Newton's method is <em>slower</em> than the bisection method.</p>
          <h4 id="convergencenewton">Convergence of Newton's Method</h4>
          <p>But maybe Newton's method will converge faster than the bisection method will? Let's look back at the error equation `e_(n+1) = (f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n))(e_n)^2`. If we start with an initial guess close enough to `r`, then `(f''(xi_n))/(2f'(x_n)) ~~ (f''(r))/(2f'(r))`, which is a constant, so we can call it `c`. Then the error for Newton's method can be represented as `e_(n+1) ~~ c(e_n)^2`.</p>

          <p>From this, we can see that Newton's method (generally) converges faster than the bisection method. The convergence of Newton's method is described as "quadratic convergence" because of the power `2`.</p>

It's possible that Newton's method won't converge at all (when `f' = 0` and/or `f''` doesn't exist). However, there are some theorems that guarantee the convergence of Newton's method.</p>
          <p><b>Let's suppose `f'(x)`,`f''(x)` are continuous around `x = r` and `f'(r) != 0`. Then it turns out that if we start with an intial guess close enough to `r`, we can get `x_n -> r` (i.e. the `n^(th)` approximation will approach `r`).</b></p>

            <p>Solving Systems with `2` variables:</p>
            <p>Suppose we wanted to solve a system like this: `{(f_1(x_1,x_2),=,0),(f_2(x_1,x_2),=,0):}` where `(r_1,r_2)` is the root</p>
            <p>Using Taylor series, we can represent `f_1` as:</p>
            <div class="math">
              <p>`f_1(r_1,r_2) ~~ color(blue)(f_1(x_1^((0)),r_2)) + color(green)((delf_1)/(delx_1)(x_1^((0)),r_2)(r_1-x_1^((0))))`</p>
              <p>`~~ color(blue)(f_1(x_1^((0)),x_2^((0))) + (delf_1)/(delx_2)(x_1^((0)),x_2^((0)))(r_2-x_2^((0))) + color(green)((delf_1)/(delx_1)(x_1^((0)),x_2^((0)))(r_1-x_1^((0))))`</p>

            <p>And similarly for `f_2`:</p>

          <p>So Newton's method converges faster than the bisection method does, but it requires more function evaluations. Is there a method that converges faster than the bisection method and requires less function evaluations than Newton's method does?</p>
          <p>Newton's method looked at tangent lines. Let's look instead at secant lines.</p>
          <p>The secant method is a variation of Newton's method. It still uses the iterative formula `x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/(f'(x_n))`, but the difference is that `f'(x_n)` will be the slope of the secant line, not the tangent line.</p>
          <p>The derivative can be calculated by `f'(a) = lim_(x->a) (f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)`. Without the limit, it can be approximated by `f'(a) ~~ (f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)`.</p>
          <div class="math">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/secant.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>One way to get `f'(x_n)` is to consider the slope of the secant line through `x_(n-1)` and `x_n`. Then we have `f'(x_n) ~~ (f(x_n)-f(x_(n-1)))/(x_n-x_(n-1))`. This leads to the iterative formula for the secant method:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/((f(x_n)-f(x_(n-1)))/(x_n-x_(n-1)))`</p>
            <p>`x_(n+1) = x_n - (f(x_n)(x_n - x_(n-1)))/(f(x_n)-f(x_(n-1)))`</p>
          </div>
          <p>The idea is that we're getting our next approximation by drawing the secant line through our previous two approximations.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/nonlinear/secant_method.jpg">

Then we have `x_(n+1) = F(x_n)`. So we plug in `x_n` and get out `x_(n+1)`. Let's suppose that we do this enough times so that `x_n -> s`. Then:</p>
          <div class="math">

          <p>This is the graphical interpretation of looking at fixed points. Notice that the point is on the line `y = x` and `y = F(x)`. So `x = F(x)`.</p>
          <h4 id="convergencefixedpoint">Convergence of the Fixed Point Method</h4>
          <p>Let's suppose the fixed point iterations converge to `s`. To look at the convergence, let's look at how the error compares to the error of Newton's method.</p>
          <p>So let's start with `e_(n+1) = x_(n+1) - s`. From the formula `x_(n+1) = F(x_n)` and the definition of fixed point, we get:</p>

          </div>
          <p>To introduce `x_n - s = e_n`, we can look at the Taylor series expansion of `F(x_n)`:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`color(green)(F(x_n)) - F(s)`</p>

            <p><b>The story thus far:</b> Instead of looking at solving problems of the form `f(x) = 0`, we look at solving problems of the form `f(x) = x`. Finding an `x` such that `f(x) = x` is done with the fixed point method. In order for the fixed point method to converge, `F` has to be contractive, which means that there exists a positive `lambda lt 1` such that `abs(F(x)-F(y)) le lambdaabs(x-y)`.

          <p>Going back to the root-finding problem, we've been able to find just one root. It would be nice to be able to use the algorithms to find all the roots. It turns out that we actually can do this with polynomials because of their special properties.</p>

          <p>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that every nonconstant polynomial has at least one root in the complex field.

          <p>We can divide polynomials just like we can divide numbers. If we divide a polynomial `p(x)` (which has degree of at least `1`) by a linear polynomial `(x-s)`, then the result is a quotient `q(x)` (which is a polynomial) and a remainder `r`.</p>
          <div class="math">

          <p>A special case of the Remainder Theorem — called the Factor Theorem — combines the two points above: `p(s) = 0 iff p(x) = (x-s)q(x)`.

          <h3 id="dividerinserepeat">Divide, Rinse, &amp; Repeat (To a Certain Degree)</h3>
          <p>So we can use the algorithms to find one root of `p(x)`, call it `r_1`, and then divide `p(x)` by `(x-r_1)` to get `p(x) = (x-r_1)q(x)`. Then we can use the algorithms to find the root of `q(x)`, call it `r_2`, and divide `q(x)` by `(x-r_2)` to get `p(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)u(x)`. Wait, it seems like we can just keep on dividing forever. There's actually a limit to the number of times we can divide polynomials, and it involves looking at the degrees of the polynomials.</p>
          <p>Recall that when we multiply like terms with exponents, we add the exponents. Like `x^2 * x^3 = x^5`.</p>
          <p>If `p(x)` has degree `n`, then `(x-s)q(x)` also needs to have degree `n` (since they're equal to each other). Well, `(x-s)` has degree `1`, which means `q(x)` needs to have degree `n-1` (notice that gives us `1 + (n-1) = n`). Also notice that the degree of `q(x)` is `1` less than the degree of `p(x)`. In a very rough sense, the degree is decreasing by `1` every time we divide.</p>
          <p>We can only divide polynomials `p(x)` by linear polynomials `(x-s)` as long as `p(x)` has degree greater than `0`. Since the degree is "decreasing by `1` every time we divide", if `p(x)` has degree `n`, then we can only divide it `n` times. The result is that:</p>

            <p>In the case when `n=1`, there are `2` points. And there is only one unique line (polynomial of degree `1`) passing through `2` points.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>The polynomial that interpolates the data points is `p(x) = sum_(i = 0)^n y_i prod_(j=0, j != i)^n (x-x_j)/(x_i-x_j)`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseExistencePoly">
              <p>Let's start with the table of data points</p>
              <div class="flex">
                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="dark-right-border">`x`</td>
                    <td>`x_0`</td>
                    <td>`x_1`</td>
                    <td>`...`</td>
                    <td>`x_n`</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="dark-right-border">`y`</td>
                    <td>`y_0`</td>
                    <td>`y_1`</td>
                    <td>`...`</td>
                    <td>`y_n`</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              </div>
              <p>We could represent `y` by a vector as follows:</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>`y = [[y_0], [y_1], [vdots], [y_n]] = y_0[[1], [0], [0], [vdots], [0]] + y_1[[0], [1], [0], [vdots], [0]] + ... + y_n[[0], [0], [vdots], [0], [1]]`</p>
              </div>
              <p>Then we take each vector and make a table for each one. Taking `y_0[[1], [0], [0], [vdots], [0]]` as an example:</p>
              <div class="flex">
                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="dark-right-border">`x`</td>
                    <td>`x_0`</td>
                    <td>`x_1`</td>
                    <td>`...`</td>
                    <td>`x_n`</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="dark-right-border">`y`</td>
                    <td>`1`</td>
                    <td>`0`</td>
                    <td>`...`</td>
                    <td>`0`</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              </div>
              <p>Now we can find`color(red)(text(*))` a polynomial of degree less than or equal to `n` interpolating these points. Let's call the polynomial `l_0(x)`</p>
              <p>Doing this for each vector, we get `p(x) = y_0l_0(x) + y_1l_1(x) + ... + y_nl_n(x)` (note that `deg\ p le n`)</p>
              <p>By the way we set things up, for `x = [[x_0], [x_1], [vdots], [x_n]], p(x_i) = sum_(j=0)^n y_jl_j(x_i)` where `l_j(x_i) = {(0\ text(if)\ i != j),(1\ text(if)\ i = j):}`</p>
              <p>This means `p(x_i) = y_i`, so `p(x) = [[y_0], [y_1], [vdots], [y_n]] = y`</p>
              <p>`color(red)(text(*))`By the way we set things up, `l_0(x)` has roots at `x_1, ..., x_n` (and not at `x_0`)</p>
              <p>So `l_0(x) = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_n)q(x)` where `q(x)` is a constant</p>
              <p>We can find what the constant is by looking at `l_0(x_0) = 1`</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>`1 = l_0(x_0) = (x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)...(x_0-x_n)q(x)`</p>
                <p>`q(x) = 1/((x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)...(x_0-x_n))`</p>
              </div>
              <p>So `l_0(x) = ((x-x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_n))/((x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)...(x_0-x_n))`</p>
              <p>Generally,</p>
              <div class="math">
                <p>`l_i(x) = ((x-x_0)...(x-x_(i-1))(x-x_(i+1))...(x-x_n))/((x_i-x_0)...(x_i-x_(i-1))(x_i-x_(i+1))...(x_i-x_n))`</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExistencePoly">Proof of Existence</a>
          </div>
          <p>The polynomial obtained using this formula is called the <b>Lagrange polynomial</b>.</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>Let's suppose we have these data points:</p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td class="dark-right-border">`x`</td>
                <td>`1`</td>
                <td>`2`</td>
                <td>`3`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="dark-right-border">`y`</td>
                <td>`-3`</td>
                <td>`5`</td>
                <td>`-9`</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Then `p(x) = -3(((x-2)(x-3))/((1-2)(1-3))) + 5(((x-1)(x-3))/((2-1)(2-3))) - 9(((x-1)(x-2))/((3-1)(3-2)))`</p>
            <p>The idea is that if we plug in `x = 1`, we should get `p(1) = -3`. We make sure that happens by making sure the numerator is `0` for the second and third terms when we plug in `x = 1`. We also make sure that everything inside the parentheses of the first term cancels out when we plug in `x=1`.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p>To easily see uniqueness, let's suppose we have a smaller table:</p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td class="dark-right-border">`x`</td>
                <td>`1`</td>
                <td>`2`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="dark-right-border">`y`</td>
                <td>`-3`</td>
                <td>`5`</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Using the point-slope formula, the line passing through these `2` points is `y + 3 = (5-(-3))/(2-1)(x-1) => y = 8x - 11`</p>
            <p>Then `p(x) = -3((x-2)/(1-2)) + 5((x-1)/(2-1)) = 3(x-2) + 5(x-1) = 3x - 6 + 5x - 5 = 8x -11`</p>
